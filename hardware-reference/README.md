## Relationship to Software License

**Key Distinction**:
- **Software (ModuleCPU firmware)**: AGPL-3.0-or-later with broad patent grant for software use
- **Hardware (these designs)**: Non-commercial patent grant only; commercial use requires separate license

**Why the Difference?**
- Software improvements benefit the ecosystem when shared (AGPL ensures sharing)
- Hardware manufacturing involves significant capital investment, safety liability, and certification costs
- Patent coverage primarily relates to hardware architecture and hierarchical topology

**Can I modify the software for use on different hardware?**
- Yes! The AGPL-3.0 software license and patent grant apply to the software
- You can run modified ModuleCPU software on your own hardware implementations
- Commercial hardware sales still require a hardware patent license

## Integration with CellCPU

ModuleCPU hardware is designed to work with CellCPU cell controllers:
- **CellCPU**: https://github.com/dp-web4/CellCPU
- **Communication**: Virtual UART at 20kbps
