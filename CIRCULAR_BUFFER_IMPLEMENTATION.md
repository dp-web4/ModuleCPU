# Circular Buffer Implementation Complete

## Overview
Successfully implemented circular buffer for storing multiple string readings in the 896-byte frame buffer. The system now preserves a history of cell readings with proper handling of missing/non-reporting cells.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Invalid Cell Markers
- `INVALID_CELL_VOLTAGE = 0xFFFF`
- `INVALID_CELL_TEMP = 0x7FFF`
- Cells that don't report retain these markers
- Clear indication of which cells are missing in each reading

### 2. Dynamic Buffer Sizing
Based on cell count, the buffer automatically sizes:
- **20 cells**: 11 readings (80 bytes each)
- **50 cells**: 4 readings (200 bytes each)
- **94 cells**: 2 readings (376 bytes each)

### 3. Helper Functions
```c
// Access specific slot
GetStringDataAtIndex(frame, index)
GetStringDataAtIndexVolatile(frame, index)

// Current writing slot
GetStringData(frame)
GetStringDataVolatile(frame)

// Latest complete reading for CAN
GetLatestCompleteString(frame)
```

### 4. Buffer Management
- **Initialization**: All cells marked invalid at READ frame start
- **Data Collection**: Valid cells overwrite invalid markers
- **Advancement**: Always advances at WRITE frame end
- **Frame Counter**: Increments with each reading

## Implementation Locations

### STORE.h
- Invalid cell markers defined
- Helper functions for buffer access
- FrameMetadata with nstrings, currentIndex, readingCount

### main.c
- **Line 543-577**: Initialize nstrings in CellCountExpectedSet()
- **Line 2267-2274**: Initialize buffer slot with invalid markers at READ
- **Line 2240-2252**: Advance buffer at WRITE frame
- **Line 1941**: CAN responses use GetLatestCompleteString()

## Benefits
1. **Never Gets Stuck**: Always advances even with missing cells
2. **Complete History**: Multiple readings preserved in single frame
3. **Power-Loss Safe**: All readings persist in 1024-byte frame
4. **Clear Diagnostics**: Invalid markers show exactly which cells dropped

## Memory Usage
- Program: 21,107 bytes (32% of 65,536)
- Data: 2,700 bytes (66% of 4,096)
- Still plenty of room for future features

## Testing Results
✅ Compiles successfully
✅ Cell data properly reported to pack controller
✅ Invalid markers for non-reporting cells
✅ Buffer advances correctly
✅ CAN responses working with latest complete reading

## Next Steps
The system is ready for:
- SD card writes with complete frame history
- Pack controller to analyze cell reliability patterns
- Potential compression of multiple readings
- Historical analysis of cell dropouts
