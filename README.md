# ModuleCPU

**ModBatt Battery Management System - Module Controller**

## Overview

ModuleCPU is the middle-tier controller in ModBatt's hierarchical battery management system, coordinating up to 128 individual CellCPUs while reporting aggregated data to the Pack Controller. It demonstrates how distributed intelligence principles can be applied to embedded battery management at the module scale.

**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ **Production-ready** - Complete firmware with CAN bus communication, VUART cell management, and hierarchical coordination

### Quick Facts

- **Target Platform**: ATmega64M1 microcontroller (8-bit AVR with CAN)
- **Manages**: Up to 128 CellCPUs via Virtual UART daisy-chain
- **Uplink**: CAN 2.0B bus to Pack Controller (250kbps)
- **Features**: Dual-phase operation, RTC timestamping, robust error handling
- **Role**: Middle management - aggregates cell data, coordinates without micromanaging

## Web4 Ecosystem Context

ModuleCPU can be viewed as a practical demonstration of trust-native architecture patterns applied to embedded battery management:

**Philosophical Framework**: [Synchronism](https://github.com/dp-web4/Synchronism) - Patterns of scale-based coordination and distributed intelligence
**Technical Standard**: [Web4](https://github.com/dp-web4/web4) - Concepts like unforgeable identity and witnessed relationships
**Implementation**: [CellCPU](https://github.com/dp-web4/CellCPU) ‚Üí **ModuleCPU** (this) ‚Üí [Pack-Controller](https://github.com/dp-web4/Pack-Controller-EEPROM)

### Design Patterns

ModuleCPU's architecture reflects several patterns that align with Web4 and Synchronism concepts:

- **Identity**: Module serial number framework ready for LCT binding
- **Interface Boundaries**: Well-defined information hiding between layers (CAN upward, VUART downward)
- **Relationship Tracking**: Module maintains awareness of Pack Controller and 94 cells
- **Hierarchical Coordination**: Operates autonomously within constraints from Pack
- **Information Aggregation**: Compresses 188 cell data points into module-level summaries
- **Emergent Intelligence**: System-level balancing from distributed local decisions

See [WEB4_INTEGRATION.md](WEB4_INTEGRATION.md) for how Web4 concepts map to embedded design.
See [SYNCHRONISM_PRINCIPLES.md](SYNCHRONISM_PRINCIPLES.md) for architectural patterns and philosophy.

- **Coordination**: Enables balancing, tracks cell health, detects faults

### üì° Pack Communication
- **Protocol**: CAN 2.0B extended frames with module ID addressing
- **Registration**: Dynamic ID assignment (1-31) from Pack Controller
- **Reporting**: Module-level status, aggregated cell data, error conditions
- **Commands**: State changes, balancing control, time synchronization

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Capabilities
- **Dual-Phase Operation**: Separate read/write phases for data integrity
- **RTC Support**: Real-time clock for timestamping
- **Error Handling**: Robust timeout and recovery mechanisms
- **State Management**: OFF/STANDBY/ACTIVE/BALANCE states with safety checks

### üéØ Performance
- **Memory**: 64KB Flash, 4KB SRAM
- **Response Time**: <50ms for full cell poll cycle (94 cells)
- **CAN Reliability**: Timeout recovery, bus-off handling, error counting
- **Cell Tracking**: Bitmap and statistics for each cell position

## Protocol Synchronization

**Important**: ModuleCPU uses shared CAN protocol definitions maintained in the Pack-Controller-EEPROM repository.

**Authoritative Source**: [Pack-Controller-EEPROM/protocols/](https://github.com/dp-web4/Pack-Controller-EEPROM/tree/main/protocols)
**Local Copy**: `protocols/` (synchronized via `scripts/sync_protocols.sh`)

To update protocols after changes in Pack-Controller:
```bash
./scripts/sync_protocols.sh
# Review changes, test build, commit
```

See `protocols/SYNC_NOTICE.md` for synchronization procedure and versioning.
